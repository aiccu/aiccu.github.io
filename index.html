  <details>
    <summary>Why does AICCU need the Annual Member Survey?</summary>
  <font color="#0063a6">In short, <i><b>it is critical to our state-level advocacy.</i></b> Much of the advocacy work that is done on behalf of AICCU institutions focus on where state funding and independent institutions intersect (CalGrant, Community College Transfers). The private non-profit sector in California is diverse and complex. Responses from our members is critical to giving policymakers and other stakeholders an fuller story of the important work that is being done in the sector.
    <br><br>For example, legislative efforts to increase the CalGrant formula hinged on our survey collection in 2017. AICCU used this survey data to count aggregate Hispanic CalGrant students in the Independent sector, which played a key role in gaining the support of the Latino Caucus. This information is not collected by CSAC and is thus only available in aggregate via these surveys. Compare this to centralized collection that occurs in the CSU/UCs. </font>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Could AICCU pull these datapoints from IPEDS?</summary>
  <font color="#0063a6">No. The questions requested in this survey We are constantly striving to  </font>
  </details>
   <br>
  <details>
    <summary>Will we have access to this information in the future?</summary>
  <font color="#0063a6">Starting in 2020, we will  </font>
  </details>
   <br>
  <details>
    <summary>Can I submit the survey in spreadsheet format?</summary>
  <font color="#0063a6">We would prefer it be sent through our SurveyMonkey link due to added validation rules that will help speed up cleaning and data management. However, please reach out to Randy Tarnowski (randy.tarnowski@aiccu.edu) if there is an outstanding reason for spreadsheet submission </font>
  </details>
  <br>
  <details>
    <summary>What has changed since last year&rsquo;s collection</summary>
    <font color="#0063a6">In addition to this document, we have reduced the number of questions by a third. We have also extended the overall deadline. </font>
  </details>
  <br>
  <details>
    <summary>Can I save my progress in SurveyMonkey?</summary>
    <font color="#0063a6">Yes, unlike previous years you are permitted to save responses, as well as edit after submitting. &ldquo;You can allow people who take your survey to edit their responses either while completing the survey or after they submit the survey, or you can prevent respondents from editing their responses after they submit them.&rdquo;</font>
  </details>
    <br>
  <details>
    <summary>How will these data be used?</summary>
    <font color="#0063a6">All information collected through the survey will only be reported in the aggregate and the sector report will be compiled by AICCU?</font>
